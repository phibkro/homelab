# Gotchas

Lessons learned the hard way during Phase 5. Read before doing anything that touches these areas.

## NVMe `/dev` enumeration is unstable

Same physical drive can appear at different `/dev/nvmeNn1` paths between boots. On nori-station: at install time the WD Black SN750 was `/dev/nvme0n1` and the Corsair Force MP510 (Windows) was `/dev/nvme1n1`. After the first reboot they swapped — SN750 is now `nvme1n1`, MP510 is now `nvme0n1`.

**Implication**: never reference `/dev/nvmeN` directly in disko configs or destructive commands. Use `/dev/disk/by-id/<model>-<serial>` paths. They follow the hardware. The disko configs in this repo are by-id-pinned for this reason — a re-run with the original `/dev/nvme0n1` config today would wipe Windows.

Re-derive the current mapping any time you're unsure: `ls /dev/disk/by-id/`.

## Caddy: `acmeCA = "internal"` is wrong

Looks like the right knob, isn't. NixOS module's `services.caddy.acmeCA` takes an ACME directory URL — Caddy will literally try to `dial tcp: lookup internal` and fail.

The right way to switch every vhost to Caddy's internal CA:

```nix
services.caddy.globalConfig = "local_certs";
```

## Caddy: "failed to install root certificate" is non-fatal

When Caddy generates its internal CA, it tries to install the root cert into `/etc/ssl/certs/...` via `tee`. The systemd-hardened service can't write there. You get a noisy error log like:

```
pki.ca.local | failed to install root certificate | error: failed to execute tee: exit status 1
```

Caddy continues serving certs anyway from its own store. Ignore the error. We install the root CA on devices manually + add it to the system trust store via `security.pki.certificateFiles`.

## Python doesn't trust the system CA — `certifi` ships its own

`security.pki.certificateFiles` adds your CA to `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt` — Go, curl, openssl, libcurl all pick it up. **Python doesn't.** httpx / requests / urllib3 default to certifi's bundled trust store, which doesn't include local CAs.

Symptom: `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate`.

Fix: set `SSL_CERT_FILE = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt"` (and optionally `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` for older requests-based libs) in the service's environment.

## sops env-file format: `=`, not `:`

sops stores everything as YAML, which uses `key: value`. systemd's `EnvironmentFile=` expects env-file syntax: `KEY=VALUE`. When putting an env file into sops as a block string:

```yaml
gatus-env: |
  NTFY_CHANNEL=nori-claude-jhiugyfthgcv     # CORRECT
  NTFY_CHANNEL: nori-claude-jhiugyfthgcv    # WRONG — looks like YAML, won't be loaded
  NTFY-CHANNEL=...                          # WRONG — env vars must be UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
```

Cost us 4 iteration cycles when first wiring Gatus. systemd silently drops unparseable lines — no error, just env vars never appear in the process.

## sops block-string indentation matters

When using `|` for multi-line YAML values, the indent depth is significant. Tabs don't work — use 2 spaces:

```yaml
authelia-oidc-issuer-private-key: |
  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
  MIIE...
  -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

If indent is wrong (or the value lands on the same line as the key), sops decrypts to an empty string. `sops -d secrets/secrets.yaml | grep <key>` is the fastest way to verify a value is non-empty.

## DynamicUser services: ownership trickery

NixOS services using `DynamicUser=yes` (open-webui, ollama, ntfy-sh, gatus, beszel-hub) get a fresh ephemeral UID at each session. From outside the service namespace, files appear owned `nobody:nogroup`. Implications:

- `chown ollama:ollama /var/lib/ollama` fails — that user doesn't exist statically. Use `chown --reference=<existing-file>` to copy ownership from a sibling.
- StateDirectory= mechanism makes `/var/lib/<name>` appear externally; actual storage is `/var/lib/private/<name>` (bind mount).
- To grant a DynamicUser service read access to /run/secrets files (mode 0440 root:keys), set `SupplementaryGroups = [ "keys" ]` in the systemd unit override.

## Authelia 4.39 requires HTTPS for `authelia_url`

You can't set `authelia_url = "http://..."` in the cookies config — Authelia rejects it at config-validation time as "does not have a secure scheme". Need real HTTPS.

For tailnet-only access, two paths:
1. **`tailscale serve` with HTTPS termination** (auto-LE certs for tailnet hostname): one-time imperative `sudo tailscale serve --bg --https=PORT http://localhost:9091`. Persists in tailscaled state.
2. **Caddy reverse proxy** with internal CA (current setup): `https://auth.nori.lan` via Caddy.

Either works. We chose (2) for consistency with the rest of the *.nori.lan services.

## Tailscale Serve / HTTPS Certs need to be enabled in admin first

`tailscale serve --https=...` returns "Serve is not enabled on your tailnet" until you toggle it in the Tailscale admin console. The CLI gives you the link to click. One-time action per tailnet.

## macOS rsync is openrsync, not GNU rsync

`/usr/bin/rsync` on Sequoia+ is `openrsync` (BSD reimplementation). Many GNU flags missing: `-A` (ACLs), `-X` (xattrs), `--info=stats2`. Worse: openrsync may exit 0 after dumping usage to stderr, so `set -e` doesn't catch it.

For Mac→host rsync, stick to BSD-supported subset: `-aH --no-owner --no-group --stats --partial`. Or install GNU rsync via `brew install rsync` (lands at `/opt/homebrew/bin/rsync`, ahead of `/usr/bin/rsync` on PATH).

## Blocky needs `bootstrapDns` when serving its own host

If nori-station's `/etc/resolv.conf` points at Tailscale's stub (`100.100.100.100`) AND Tailscale's global nameserver is set to nori-station's Blocky (via admin DNS push), there's a self-loop on Blocky restart: Blocky needs DNS to download blocklists, but its own DNS isn't serving yet.

Fix: configure `services.blocky.settings.bootstrapDns` with direct upstream IPs. Used only for Blocky's own outbound URL resolution, bypasses `/etc/resolv.conf`.

```nix
bootstrapDns = [
  { upstream = "1.1.1.1"; }
  { upstream = "9.9.9.9"; }
];
```

Symptom of missing bootstrap: blocklist download times out, denylist ends up empty (count=0), services like doubleclick.net resolve to real CDN IPs instead of 0.0.0.0.

## PocketBase 0.36 OAuth2: per-collection, not global

PocketBase moved OAuth provider configuration from system-wide settings to per-collection (each auth-type collection has its own OAuth config). For Beszel, the auth collection is `users`. Path: Collections (database icon) → users → ⚙ Options → OAuth2 tab. Or via the "Auth with OAuth2" overlay menu (which is greyed out until OAuth2 is enabled for the collection).

## `services.beszel.hub.openFirewall` doesn't exist

The Beszel module doesn't expose `openFirewall`. Use `networking.firewall.interfaces."tailscale0".allowedTCPPorts = [ 8090 ];` instead. Other NixOS service modules vary; trust `nixos-option` over assumption.

## `services.ollama.acceleration = "cuda"` is deprecated

Removed in current nixpkgs. Use `package = pkgs.ollama-cuda` instead. First build of `ollama-cuda` is slow (~30 min) — nvcc compiles GGML for many CUDA arches and binary cache often misses.

## Gatus ntfy provider: `topic` and `url` are separate

Easy mistake: putting topic in URL like `https://ntfy.sh/<channel>`. Gatus's ntfy provider expects them as separate fields:

```nix
alerting.ntfy = {
  url = "https://ntfy.sh";
  topic = "\${NTFY_CHANNEL}";  # via env substitution
  priority = 4;
};
```

If you put topic in URL, Gatus silently disables the provider (`Ignoring provider=ntfy due to error=topic not set`) — no errors at runtime, alerts just don't send.

## Pre-Phase-5 backups (`scripts/backup.sh`) have no integrity verification

`scripts/backup.sh` writes a manifest from in-the-moment `du` of the destination directory. There's no post-write verification, no comparison on subsequent runs. Files can disappear between backup and restore (manual deletion, exfat corruption) and the manifest still claims success. Treat any pre-Phase-5 rsync-to-exfat backup as a snapshot of intent, not a guaranteed source of truth.

For Phase 5+, restic (`backup-restic.nix`) provides `restic check` + content-addressed integrity by design.
