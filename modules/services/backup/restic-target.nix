  # Restic backup target — chrooted SFTP-only user.
  #
  # Lets remote hosts (workstation, future pi/pavilion) push restic
  # snapshots to this host's /mnt/backup. The `restic` user has no
  # shell, no port forwarding, and an OpenSSH ChrootDirectory locking
  # them to /mnt/backup. Repository paths in the workstation's
  # `nori.backupTargets.onetouch.repository` string look like
  # `sftp:restic@<host>:/<jobname>` — the leading slash is the chroot
  # root, i.e. /mnt/backup on the real fs.
  #
  # The chroot guarantees:
  #   ChrootDirectory must be owned by root and not group/other-writable.
  #   Ext4 mount-root inherits root:root 0755 from the filesystem, so
  #   /mnt/backup satisfies this automatically when the OneTouch is
  #   mounted. Per-job subdirs (/mnt/backup/<job>) are restic-owned;
  #   restic creates them via `initialize = true` on first push.
  #
  # ── Onboarding existing repos (one-time after the OneTouch moves) ─
  # The drive's existing per-job dirs were created by workstation's
  # root, so they're root:root. Hand ownership to the new restic user
  # so the SFTP client can write:
  #   sudo chown -R restic:restic /mnt/backup/{<job1>,<job2>,...}
  # Skip /mnt/backup itself — that must stay root-owned for chroot.
